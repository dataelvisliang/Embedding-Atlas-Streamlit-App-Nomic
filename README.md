# embedding_atlas_nomic_streamlit

A lightweight Python project that combines embedding visualization with Streamlit, leveraging Nomic's Atlas to help you explore embedding data interactively.

## What It Does

- Loads embedding vectors and related metadata
- Uses Nomic Atlas for visualizing clusters and relationships in the embeddings
- Provides an easy-to-use Streamlit web app for interactive exploration

## Why Use This

If you have embedding data and want a quick way to explore the clusters and patterns visually, this project gives you a fast and simple starting point without heavy setup.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python installed. Then, clone the repo, install dependencies, and run the application:


## Who Is This For

- Data scientists or machine learning engineers working with embeddings
- Developers needing a quick prototype for embedding visualization

## Notes

- The current setup is basic and meant to be a foundation. Feel free to adapt it to fit your data or add new features.
- Contributions and feedback are welcome!
