# Embedding Atlas - Powered by Nomic Embed V1.5 🚀
A lightweight Python project that combines embedding visualization with Streamlit, leveraging Nomic's Atlas to help you explore embedding data interactively.

## What It Does 🎯
- Loads embedding vectors and related metadata
- Uses Nomic Atlas for visualizing clusters and relationships in the embeddings
- Provides an easy-to-use Streamlit web app for interactive exploration

## Why Use This? 🤔
If you have embedding data and want a quick way to explore the clusters and patterns visually, this project gives you a fast and simple starting point without heavy setup.

## Getting Started 🛠️
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, clone the repo, install dependencies, and run the application:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dataelvisliang/embedding_atlas_nomic_streamlit.git
cd embedding_atlas_nomic_streamlit
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run 3_visualize_atlas_with_llm_deploy.py
```

## Who Is This For? 👩‍💻👨‍💻
- Data scientists or machine learning engineers working with embeddings
- Developers needing a quick prototype for embedding visualization

## Notes 📝
- The current setup is basic and meant to be a foundation. Feel free to adapt it to fit your data or add new features.
- Contributions and feedback are welcome! 🌟
